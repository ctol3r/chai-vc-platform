# Chai VC Platform

End-to-end healthcare credentialing and hiring verification.

## ACA-Py Agent

The platform includes an Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) microservice that issues and verifies healthcare credentials. The agent is configured to support both Hyperledger AnonCreds and W3C Verifiable Credentials so that clinicians can selectively disclose information during onboarding.

See `aca_py_agent/README.md` for usage.
