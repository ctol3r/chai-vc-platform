## Bug Bounty Program

We have launched an internal bug bounty program to improve platform security.

### How to submit a report

1. Install dependencies for the reporting interface:
   ```bash
   pip install -r bug-bounty/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python bug-bounty/app.py
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser and fill out the bug report form.

Submitted reports are stored in `bug-bounty/bug_reports.txt` on the server.
