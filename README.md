# Chai VC Platform

End-to-end healthcare credentialing and hiring verification.

This repository contains a minimal scaffold for the Chai VC platform. The
backend includes a stubbed `ChainlinkAdapter` for retrieving cross-chain data
feeds such as license status and risk signals. These adapters are exposed
through the `BlockchainIntegration` class.
