## CI Pipelines

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that demonstrates how to deploy smart contracts across multiple blockchain platforms. The `multi-chain-deploy.yml` workflow contains jobs for EVM, Substrate, and CosmWasm deployments. Each job installs the appropriate toolchain, builds the contract, and runs a placeholder deployment step when changes are merged to the `main` branch.
