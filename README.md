# Chai VC Platform

End-to-end healthcare credentialing and hiring verification.

This repository now includes the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.0
context inside the credential registry pallet under `backend/src/credential_registry`.
This integration provides a foundation for validating credentials against the
standard VC schema.
