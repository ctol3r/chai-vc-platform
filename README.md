# Chai VC Platform

End-to-end healthcare credentialing and hiring verification.

## Wallet UX

The demonstration wallet now includes a **Share only status** toggle on the
credential details page. Enabling this option shares a simple proof that the
credential exists and is valid instead of exposing the entire verifiable
credential payload. The proof generation is stubbed in the frontend but serves
as a placeholder for future cryptographic implementations.
