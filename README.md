## Sample CME Token Demo

The repository now includes a simple example token. You can mint a sample
Continuing Medical Education (CME) token using the `mintSampleCmeToken`
function located in `backend/src/blockchain/cme_token_minter.ts`. The
`frontend/pages/wallet.tsx` page renders a wallet timeline that displays this
token as a badge.
