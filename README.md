## Governance Token

The `GovernanceToken` smart contract located under `backend/src/blockchain/contracts`
implements an ERC20-compatible token with weighted voting and linear vesting
schedules. Token holders can delegate their votes to another address, and
vesting schedules allow timed release of allocated tokens.
