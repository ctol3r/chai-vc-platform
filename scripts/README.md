# SOC 2 Evidence Collection

This directory contains utilities used to parse compliance reports for SOC 2 evidence. `collect_terraform_evidence.py` reads a JSON report generated by [`terraform-compliance`](https://terraform-compliance.com) and writes a simplified evidence file that can be attached to audit records.

## Usage

```bash
python scripts/collect_terraform_evidence.py path/to/report.json evidence.json
```

The resulting `evidence.json` summarizes passed and failed scenarios and includes the original results for reference.
