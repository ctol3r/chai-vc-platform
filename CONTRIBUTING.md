# Contributing to Chai VC Platform

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We follow a few conventions to keep
the project consistent.

## Commit messages

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification. Commit messages should follow the pattern:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

Where `type` is one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.
Examples:

- `feat(auth): add login endpoint`
- `fix(ui): correct dashboard layout`

Using this style allows automated commit linting.

## Pull requests

Before opening a pull request:

1. Ensure your branch builds and tests successfully.
2. Follow the commit message guidelines above.
3. Use the pull request template located in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
