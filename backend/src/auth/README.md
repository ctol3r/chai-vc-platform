# WebAuthn/OIDC Bridge

This module contains a minimal skeleton for bridging WebAuthn and
OpenID Connect (OIDC). It allows a CHAI DID to authenticate through
WebAuthn and then obtain an OIDC authorization code that can be used in
standard OAuth2 flows.

The current implementation is highly simplified and serves as a scaffold
for future development.
