# Performance Optimization Plan

This document outlines high-level steps and configuration tips for optimizing block size and node scaling for the Chai VC Platform. The platform's codebase currently contains placeholders, so these recommendations are theoretical and should be validated once real implementations are in place.

## Block Size
- Choose a block size appropriate for expected transaction throughput. Larger blocks can store more data but may increase propagation times.
- Benchmark different block sizes (e.g., 1 MB, 2 MB, 4 MB) under typical workloads.
- Adjust the block size in the blockchain configuration when implementing the blockchain integration.

## Node Scaling
- Deploy backend nodes with horizontal scaling using Kubernetes.
- Set up an autoscaling policy based on CPU and memory usage. Start with a target CPU utilization of 60%.
- Ensure that database and storage services can scale as node count increases.

These guidelines are placeholders until detailed performance testing is possible.
