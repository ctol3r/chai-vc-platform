# GameDay Chaos Exercise

To improve reliability, we conduct GameDay chaos exercises every quarter. These
simulated failure drills help us validate our incident response process and
identify areas for improvement.

## Schedule
- Run once every quarter (four times per year).

## Documentation
- Record each exercise's scenario, outcome, and action items in this folder.
- Summaries should be added to the project wiki or shared internally after each
  exercise.
