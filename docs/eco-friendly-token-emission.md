# Eco-Friendly Token Emission Schedule

This document outlines a sustainable approach to issuing tokens while tracking and offsetting the associated carbon footprint.

## Emission Philosophy

- **Efficiency first**: Optimize on-chain interactions to minimize energy consumption.
- **Transparency**: Publish regular reports about emissions and offsets.
- **Offset commitment**: For every unit of on-chain activity, the platform purchases verified carbon offsets.

## Example Schedule

1. **Initial Distribution**
   - 10% of the total supply is minted at launch.
   - Offsets are purchased to match the estimated energy usage of this initial mint.
2. **Monthly Emissions**
   - 2% of the remaining supply is emitted each month for community incentives.
   - Carbon metrics from the previous month determine the offset purchase for the current month.
3. **Annual Review**
   - Evaluate energy efficiency and adjust the emission rate if necessary to remain carbon neutral.

## Tracking Offsets

- Maintain a public ledger of all offset purchases, including project details and certificates.
- Integrate with carbon tracking APIs to estimate blockchain energy usage.
- Publish quarterly sustainability reports summarizing emissions, offsets, and future goals.

By adhering to this schedule and tracking strategy, the platform aims to minimize environmental impact while fostering a transparent token ecosystem.
