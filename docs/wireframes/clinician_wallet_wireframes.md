# Clinician Wallet Wireframes

This document outlines proposed high-fidelity wireframes for a clinician wallet application in both web and mobile formats. The wireframes focus on core user flows around credential management and verification, while offering a simple and intuitive user interface.

## Design Goals
- **Trustworthy**: Emphasize security and professionalism to instill confidence.
- **Accessible**: Utilize clean typography and color contrasts for readability across devices.
- **Responsive**: Provide a consistent experience on mobile and desktop with an adaptive layout.

## Overview
The clinician wallet allows professionals to store, present, and share verified digital credentials. Key screens include:
1. **Login / Onboarding**
2. **Wallet Home** (Credential list)
3. **Credential Details**
4. **Add Credential**
5. **Settings & Profile**

All wireframes use a simple navigation bar at the bottom on mobile ("Home", "Add", "Settings"). The web version utilizes a sidebar for navigation with additional screen real estate.

## 1. Login / Onboarding
- **Web**: A centered login card with the platform logo, email/password fields, and buttons for "Login" and "Create Account". Background uses subtle gradients.
- **Mobile**: A vertical layout with fullâ€‘width inputs and large buttons for touch interaction. Optional biometric login prompts (e.g., "Use Face ID") appear after first login.

**Visual Elements**
- Primary color for action buttons (e.g., `#2C7BE5` blue).
- Minimalistic background illustration referencing healthcare.
- Clear error states with red text and small icons.

---

## 2. Wallet Home (Credential List)
- **Web**: Sidebar navigation on the left. Main section lists credential cards with logo, credential type, issuing organization, and status (valid/expired). A search bar and filter dropdown appear above the list.
- **Mobile**: Bottom navigation bar. Credential cards stack vertically with swipeable actions (e.g., "Share", "View"). A floating action button in the corner allows adding a credential.

**Visual Elements**
- Cards have subtle drop shadows for depth.
- Status indicators use colored icons (green check, red exclamation for expired).
- Responsive grid on larger screens to show two columns of cards.

---

## 3. Credential Details
- **Web & Mobile**: Top section shows the credential title, issuer logo, and validity dates. A QR code for quick sharing is featured prominently. Actions include "Share", "Download", and "Verify".

**Visual Elements**
- Use a modal or drawer on mobile to display full-screen details.
- Metadata is displayed in a collapsible "Details" section: credential ID, issue date, expiration date, and issuer contact.
- Colors remain consistent with the home view for seamless transition.

---

## 4. Add Credential
- **Web**: Multi-step form with progress indicator. Steps include selecting credential type, uploading/verifying documents, and confirming details.
- **Mobile**: Full-screen stepper with large touch targets. Camera integration for document scanning.

**Visual Elements**
- Drag-and-drop document upload on web.
- Clear progress bar across steps.
- Confirmation screen with checkmark animation once completed.

---

## 5. Settings & Profile
- Manage personal details, security options (passcode/biometrics), and connected verification services.
- **Web**: Display as a tabbed settings page.
- **Mobile**: List of options with toggles and nested screens for advanced settings.

**Visual Elements**
- Consistent iconography for settings items.
- Emphasize logout and account deletion options at the bottom with caution colors.

---

## Interaction Notes
- Animations are subtle: card hover effects on web, slide transitions on mobile.
- Colors follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility. Primary actions use the platform's blue, while destructive actions use a muted red.
- Typography uses a sans-serif font (e.g., Inter or Arial). Heading hierarchy: `h1` for page titles, `h2` for section titles, and regular text for body content.

## Conclusion
These wireframes provide a foundation for implementing the clinician wallet UI across both web and mobile devices. The focus is on clarity, ease of use, and trust. Actual visual assets (logos, color palettes, fonts) can be refined by a dedicated designer, but the structure above should guide the initial implementation.
