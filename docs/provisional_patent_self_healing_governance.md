# Provisional Patent Application: Self-Healing Governance Methodology

This document provides a general outline for preparing and submitting a provisional patent application in the United States for a "Self-Healing Governance Methodology." It is not legal advice.

## 1. Describe the Invention

Clearly describe how the self-healing governance methodology works, including:

- The system or process it governs.
- How it detects issues or failures.
- How it autonomously corrects or mitigates those issues.
- Any unique algorithms or approaches used.

Include diagrams or flowcharts if they help illustrate the methodology.

## 2. Check for Novelty

Conduct a preliminary search to ensure that your methodology is unique. The USPTO website and other patent databases (e.g., Google Patents) are common starting points. If the search reveals similar inventions, you may need to refine your approach or consult a patent professional.

## 3. Draft the Provisional Application

A provisional application generally includes:

- A written description of the invention in as much detail as possible.
- Any relevant drawings, diagrams, or flowcharts.
- The names of all inventors.
- Your contact information.

There's no formal claim requirement in a provisional filing, but you should provide enough detail that someone skilled in the field could understand how to implement the methodology.

## 4. Prepare the Filing Forms

The USPTO requires specific forms when filing a provisional patent application, including:

- **Provisional Application for Patent Cover Sheet (Form PTO/SB/16)**: lists the inventors and provides basic information about the filing.
- **Fee Transmittal Form (Form PTO/SB/17)**: used to calculate and submit the filing fee. Check current fees on the USPTO website.

## 5. File Online

You can file electronically via the USPTO's **Patent Center** (formerly EFS-Web). Create an account or log in, upload your documents, and pay the fee. After submission, you will receive an application number and filing date.

Keep in mind the provisional application lasts 12 months. To obtain patent protection, you must file a non-provisional (regular) patent application within that period, claiming the benefit of the provisional filing date.

## 6. Maintain Records

Keep copies of all materials you submit, confirmation receipts, and correspondence from the USPTO. You may also want to keep lab notebooks or version histories of your methodology as proof of development and inventorship.

## 7. Consider Professional Help

If your invention is complex or you plan to pursue international patents, consult a registered patent attorney or agent. They can help refine your application and navigate the non-provisional filing process.
