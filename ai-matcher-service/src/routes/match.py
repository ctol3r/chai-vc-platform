# match.py - placeholder or stub for chai-vc-platform

"""Placeholder module for route handlers.

This module simulates a minimal API endpoint used by tests. It does not
implement any real logic but provides a function signature that can be
imported without syntax errors. Keeping the file valid Python ensures that
the project's test suite runs cleanly.
